# TeachYoself: Angular 

## Why did you choose this subject?
I've been researching entry level developer jobs in Atlanta and a lot of companies are looking for developers with Angular experience. It isn't my first pick, but I wanted to familiarize myself with the framework to be able to speak to it and my ability to learn it in interviews.

## How were you first made aware of it?
A little more than a year ago when I first started working at The Home Depot. The application that I worked on was built using angular 1.something and they were trying to refactor it (big oof).

## What problem does it solve?
It makes it easier to write web applications, which means it takes less work to build applications and helps the apps be more effecient. 

## How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
It provides a consistent way to write code, which is important for large scale applications.

## Why does one use it?
To adhere to industry best practices and to make their lives easier. 

## What are the alternatives?
* React
* Vue 

## What is it similar to, if anything?
* React
* Vue 

## What is the history of this technology?
Miško Hevery, a Google employee, released AngularJS as an open source project in 2010. In 2014, it had a total rewrite, and dropped JS, leaving Angular 2.0.

## Who built it and why?
Miško Hevery, to help make building his web applications eaisier.

## Who is maintaining it?
Open source and google.

## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
It's like React, but with more steps and TypeScript. I prefer React, honestly. Every component requires three separate files which is confusing. 

## What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
It's a pretty complicated framework with a steep learning curve. It came out in 2010 So I first started watching a tutorial from 2014 before realizing that it was pretty outdated... I muddled my way through this but I don't want to make another Angular app unless I have to.

## What resources do you recommend for interested students?

* [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf5aTYRW0E)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_intro.asp)
* [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)

## What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
Youtube, for sure.

## What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
1. Define the ng-content Directive?
2. Demonstrate navigating between different routes in an Angular application.
3. How to generate a class in Angular 7 using CLI?


## How to run
You have to create an angular app using: 
1. ng new my-first-project
2. cd my-first-project
3. ng serve

Follow the docs and the youtube tutorial I included above, and boom! You now have an Angular application. Enjoy thriving in 2014. You can even deploy to Heroku, if you want.
